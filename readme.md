## TO DO:
- [ ] /help command - shows all commands the bot has
- [ ] /lr command - sends message when last time doorbell was pressed
- [ ] Add a way to use /setup command to get CHAT_ID by the bot and store it locally, so multiple people in a household can get the bot messages
- [ ] Add a way to get removed from the CHAT_ID list
